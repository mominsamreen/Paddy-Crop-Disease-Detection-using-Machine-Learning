India is the second leading producer of paddy in the world with annual produce of about 497.7 million metric tons in the year 2019-20. The large fields of paddy require constant care and maintenance.In the proposed system, first the images are pre-processed and then the custom Convolution Neural Network is used to classify the images with 99.48% accuracy. This paper discusses the methodology for disease detection in detail. By identifying diseased leaves at an early stage, the proposed automated system can aid farmers in preventing further damage to their crops.
